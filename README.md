# Software Field Fundamentals 

## 1. What is a Variable?

A variable is used to store data in memory so your program can use it again and again.
Without variables, programs cannot remember anything.

### Real Use
storing user name, age, price, API response, etc.

### Example
```php
$userName = "Raj";

Now you can use $userName anywhere.
